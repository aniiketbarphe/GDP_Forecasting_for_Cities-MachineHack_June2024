# GDP_Forecasting_for_Cities-MachineHack_June2024

Hey there, Geeks! ‚≠ê

Macro-economic estimation and forecasting involves estimation and trend analysis of the macro-economic metrics such as GDP growth, inflation rates & unemployment rates etc. This is an essential step and approach which impacts crucial decisions from policymakers, business and investment analysts and towards that, there are establish statistical models which are utilised for generation of key inferences and insights by various small, medium & large sector players in the economy and world.

Here we have come up to with a similar challenge for you to test your statistical and data science skills and be able to generate a forecasting model to forecast or extrapolate such a macro-economic metric viz. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) based on it's past trends for a number of geographies.

Problem Statement: 
Forecast the GDP metric for the four quarters of the Financial Year 2023 and next 2 quarters of Financial Year 2024 for this hypothetical country, based on the quarterly GDP trends per city since Financial Year 2012.

Skills Tested:
EDA, Regression Models, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting. üìäüìà

Dataset:
The data-set contains the following elements:
üìÇ Training.csv: Contains quarterly level GDP metrics for cities at county level splits.
üìÇ Mapping.csv: Contains mapping between index column/row sequence in submission file with the forecast key. The "key" column is defined as concatenation of "Quarter Ending" date column and "City" column.
üìÇ Submission.csv: Standard format of the submission file with first column representing the primary key defined as concatenation of "Quarter Ending" & "City" field with the forecasted GDP values. Currently the submission file's GDP column has been inputed with 0 to replaced with appropriate values.

Hackathon Specific Rules
Participants should upload the cleaned notebook of their solution within the submission portal.
Participants are encouraged to use the discussion forum in case of any queries and doubts regarding the hackathon.

One Account Per Participant
The hackathon will allow only one account per participant.
 Submissions from multiple accounts will lead to disqualification.
All registered users are eligible to participate in the hackathon.

No Private Sharing
Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted.
 It's okay to share code if made available to all participants on the forums.
 
Submission Limits
The hackathon has a submission limit of 9 per day, after which the submissions will not be considered or evaluated.
All registered users are eligible to participate in the hackathon. We ask that you respect the spirit of the competition and do not cheat.

The evaluation will be done based on the metric "mean squared error" between the submission file and solution.
